# projects

### Projects I have made out of interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

### I have used some algorithms which include: 
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Random Forest Classifier
- K Means Clustering
- Artificial Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Anomaly Detection
- GAN
- AutoEncoders

NOTE: There is a project (Credit Card Fraud Detection) which couldn't be uploaded due to huge size of dataset. The code is uploaded.
